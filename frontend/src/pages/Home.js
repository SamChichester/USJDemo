                <p>
                    The UConn Undergraduate Science Journal is an online, open-access, peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to the select publication of independent research conducted by UConn undergraduate students within all STEM disciplines, that is any research that explores the physical sciences using the scientific method. Every submission will undergo a double-blind peer review process by the USJâ€™s Student Editor Committee and will be scored on scientific value, methodology, writing, and results. The top papers will be reviewed by the Faculty Review Committee, which consists of appointed faculty members from Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Computer Science and Engineering, and Cognitive Science and will be scored on a similar rubric. Any UConn student with a complete scientific research paper that meets the USJ requirements is eligible to apply. Members of the club will gain insight into the process of scientific writing and publishing scientific research through editing, scoring, and publishing the journal. The applicants will learn the process of submission and approval of scientific research papers. The journal is set to promote student scientific research among the UConn undergraduate student body and hopes to eliminate some barriers of getting STEM research published by undergraduate students.
